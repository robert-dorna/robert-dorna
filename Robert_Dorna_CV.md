### About me

A human that can talk to machines (wizardry, I know :D). I can code well and have strong analytical skills, plus I can talk non-stop about the latest technologies and ideas for product improvements. You can learn more about me on my website, but it's pretty typical and straight-forward: loves coding, does it in his free time, has a hobby that includes physical activity to counter long sitting hours, does something farming-related and periodically idealizes farm work. I'm a self-taught coder (dropout from Robotics), addicted to books, official guides, and manuals.
