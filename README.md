### Hi there, I'm Robert 👋

I believe in determinism (uncommon and tricky to introduce yourself in such a way, I know), and I'm a minimalist who thinks every required solution will exist and, while being functional, should be evolved into its most simple and elegant form allowed by given "effectiveness requirements". It's pretty weird, I know, but yes, I honestly do walk around normal people thinking about things such as that often 😅.

As you can guess from that, I'm also usually quiet (for the better of all of us 🤝).

GitHub is the only social media platform where I'm registered.

I also believe in actions over words, so there is not much more to say, and I already said too much. It's counterproductive to do many things at once, so I don't care much right now about anything else other than learning and working in healthcare (alternatively, improving AI, crypto, and IoT is also satisfying). Therefore, if you want to include me in some healthcare (or crypto or IoT (no experience with AI)) related project and are in doubt if I'm interested, the answer in most cases is yes [1], and here is my [CV](Robert_Dorna_CV.pdf) 🫡.

[1] - no if: [Bodypace](https://bodypace.org) is a competition to you; your product is not open source; I would not be allowed to continue Bodypace work; my salary won't be really high (four conditions have to be true at once for me to decline the offer: I really want to work in healthcare, and Bodypace is a learning experience for me, but at the same time I strongly desire to live in the world where a solution similar to Bodypace exists).


Besides that, here goes the classic GitHub introduction:

- ⚡ Fun fact: Inside the universe, you exist with your brain, which has a mental model of the universe it is in with you and your brain in it, and that brain has a mental model of the universe it is in with you and your brain in it, and that brain... ♻️.
