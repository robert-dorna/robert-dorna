### Hellllloooooo there! I'm Robert 👋

> tldr; I don't bite and enjoy creating software (Healthtech, IoT/Smart House, Crypto & ML).

I love programming, improving things and learning by both creating (DIY - Do It Yourself) and explaining/teaching.
In free time, I'm also into cooking, cycling/running (I have a treadmill, although I shouldn't run), reading and gardening - but mostly coding combined with DIY projects.

You can get to know me better by checking ouy my website https://robert-dorna.github.io or by meeting me in real-life at a meetup/conference (if it's about Healthtech, IoT (Smart House and medical devices, not everything that is shiny), Crypto or Machine Learning I might be there).

Besides that, here goes the classical GitHub introduction:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: my hobby pet projects, Tangler and Bodypace (scroll down to see them)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Software architecture, moar frameworks, advanced guides/reference manuals of my fav tools
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Writing cool software, mine or yours (mostly interested in Healthtech, IoT, Crypto & ML)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: Learning latest best programming practices
- 💬 Ask me about: My favorite food or current weather (I love checking it with `curl wttr.in` and https://windy.com 🤓)
- 📫 How to reach me: rdorna8@gmail.com (I removed all other social medias except phone with a few chat apps and I'm still enjoying my long detox from distractions. In future I wish I could remove my "WhatsApp-alike" apps and switch to matrix.org kind of vibe, will see)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first item sold on eBay was a broken laser pointer.
- 💡 Favorite quote (my bonus question): “We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.” ~Anaïs Nin
